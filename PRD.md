# AI Log Analyzer - Product Requirements Document

## Summary

The CloudWatch AI Log Analyzer is a production-ready Python script that automates AWS CloudWatch log analysis using AI. 

### Key Features:
- **Log Generator** using openAI to generate 15 lines CRITICAL or HIGH error log of Nginx or Java or CICD pipeline or system log or kubernetes --> But only generate 1 kind of log (only 1 log file, not mixed log). For example:
    - 15 lines of log critical of java application
    - 15 lines of log high of system log
    - ...
- **AI-powered analysis** using GPT-4 to identify patterns, errors, and performance issues
- **Intelligent alerting** with configurable thresholds and severity levels
- **Multi-channel notifications** send message to MS Teams through incomming webhook
- **Structured output** with JSON-formatted insights and recommendations

### Core Workflow:
1. Collects logs from Log Generator
2. Processes and formats log data for AI consumption
3. Analyzes logs using AI to detect errors, performance issues, and AWS-specific problems
4. Generates actionable alerts based on severity and configured thresholds
5. Sends notifications to integrated systems (Slack, monitoring dashboards)

### Use Cases:
- Automated monitoring of Log files
- Proactive error detection and root cause analysis
- Performance monitoring with intelligent threshold detection
- Incident response acceleration through AI-powered insights
